Feature: Target

  Targets are optional. They represent the frequency a user desires to checkin
  for a particular habit.

  The target is used to guage how close their actual performance is to desired
  performance. Targets are measured in the unit associated with the habit per time
  frame. Time frames options are daily, weekly, monthly.

  Users are able to set one target per habit and are free to edit their target at
  any time.
